# leldit

leldit is an editor implemented in rust

It can currently neither open nor write files, so it's more a textual etch
a sketch than an editor… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

```
C-c -> Quit
C-p -> Up
C-n -> Down
C-f -> Right
C-b -> Left
```

This is merely an exercise and was loosely inspired by Gary Bernhardt's twitch
stream (dead link: https://www.twitch.tv/gary_bernhardt/v/90796516).
